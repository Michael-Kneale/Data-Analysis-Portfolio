# Data Science Portfolio - Michael Kneale (46502289)

This repository contains the three sections of the portfolio I have done for COMP2200 at Macquarie University. It also contains the sets of data used for each part of the portfolio, which can be viewed in their entirety in the "files" folder found in the repository.

The project was done solely by me, although I did use lecture and reading material, as well as other online help, in order to understand how to code certain things.

The first part of the portfolio involved calculating a number of relatively simple statistics for some of the values found in the data, which pertained to several bicycle races. Some of the statistics calculated were the the total distances travelled and the speed at different levels of elevation.

The second part of the portfolio involved analysing the relationships between different local government areas and the sports for which they used sport vouchers. For instance, the local government areas with the greatest number of sports vouchers used for netball were plotted on a bar graph.

The third part of the portfolio involved creating and evaluating a predictive model for whether a customer would cease using their current mobile provider, based on variables such as plan fees and tenure. A heatmap was used to visualise the outcome of the predictive model.
